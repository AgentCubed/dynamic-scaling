Dynamic Scaling

A refactor of the original DamageEditor that dynamically adjusts boss difficulty and player damage in real-time.

Key features:
- Dynamic boss pacing: adjusts boss offense/defense based on how fast or slow the fight is relative to an expected duration (`ExpectedTotalMinutes`).
- Weapon adaptation: detects dominant player+weapon combos and reduces their effectiveness to prevent strategy-stomping (optional).
- Player damage scaling: configurable global and per-player modifiers for damage dealt and taken (`DealDamage`, `TakeDamage`, `PlayerOverrides`).
- Expected players scaling: increases incoming or boss damage when fewer players are nearby than `ExpectedPlayers`.
- Equalize deaths mode: balances difficulty across players by scaling damage based on deaths and time.
- High-health damage scaling: optional mechanic that increases player damage taken when players remain above a health threshold for too long during boss fights.
- Server-side config with debug messages and fine-grained tuning.

Usage:
-- Install on the server or client (mod includes server and client components). Configure via tModLoader Mod Config (Server side) or by editing config files.
-- Set `ExpectedTotalMinutes` to 0 to disable boss time-based scaling.
-- `WeaponAdaptationEnabled` toggles adaptation behavior.
-- High health damage scaling can be configured with `HighHealthThreshold`, `HighHealthDelaySeconds`, `HighHealthDamageIncreasePerSecond`, and `HighHealthDamageMaximum`.
