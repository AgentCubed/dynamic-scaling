[h1]Dynamic Scaling[/h1]

[b]A mod with both server and client components that dynamically adjusts boss difficulty and player damage.[/b]

[h2]What it does[/h2]
[list]
[*]Adjusts boss offense/defense based on fight pace vs an expected duration (`ExpectedTotalMinutes`).
[*]Optional weapon adaptation that nerfs dominant player+weapon combos.
[*]Configurable player damage modifiers and per-player overrides (`DealDamage`, `TakeDamage`, `PlayerOverrides`).
[*]Expected-players scaling increases or decreases damage when fewer players are nearby.
[*]Equalize deaths mode balances difficulty based on deaths and time in-fight.
[*]High-health damage scaling increases player damage taken when players stay above a health threshold for too long during boss fights.
[/list]

[h2]Quick install & usage[/h2]
[list]
[*]Install the mod on your server or client (supports both sides).
